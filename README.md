# cardCreator

The requirements were that I display a card of the dimensions shown in card print off. 
Then allow the user to customize the 
- number of points
- name
- first reagent type
- second reagent type (optional)
- reactivity notes (optional)

Additional Abilities
- make multiple copies of the card (up to 9)
- reagent words are highlighted in their appropriate color if added to notes
  * (e.g. 'This is an alkene', would display 'This is an Alkene' with the word 'Alkene' in light blue)
